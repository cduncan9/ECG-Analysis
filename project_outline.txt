1. User interface that lets users enter CSV file name that contains data
2. Load data from the CSV file
3. Check data to make sure it is in the right format and right data type.
4. Plot the ECG data
5. If the file contains a voltage reading outside of the normal range of
+/- 300 mv, add a warning entry to the log file indicating the name of the
test file and that voltages exceeded the normal range.
6. Create Metrics Dictionary
7. Calculate duration of ECG and add it to Metrics dictionary
8. Calculate voltage extremes and add it to the metrics dictionary
9. Calculate the number of heart beats and add that to the dictionary
10. Calculate the average heart rate and add it to the dictionary
11. Create a list of times that a beat occurred
12. Create a json file that outputs this dictionary
